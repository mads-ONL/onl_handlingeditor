# onl_handlingeditor

Start the resource like any other resource.

Then use `/handling carname` to open the UI

**Make sure you do not have other handling files running on the server as that overwrite the handlingeditor.**

Use the import function to import a proper handling file format of the vehicle, and export to use the edits you made
